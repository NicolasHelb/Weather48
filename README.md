# Weather48
Android Weather app for a school project made quickly (and dirty) in less than a day.

If I have time and interest I will do another pass on it to clean the code and maybe add features.





TODO:

-Update the way of granting the rights of android gps

-clean code

-add a "by city" search instead of position based

-share the selected hour forecast to contacts

-clean the ui

-add settings (skin, language selection)

-add a filter for the data to show.
